# Instant Sounds

An AutoHotkey application to quickly play sound files through a keyboard shortcut.


## Installation and usage

1. Place up to 12 sound files inside the **sounds** folder.

2. Configure **Instant Sounds.ini** with the file names and the desired volume to play each one.

3. Run **Instant Sounds.exe**

4. Press **Win** + **F1** through **F12** to play the configured sound for that key.

5. Alternately, press **Ctrl** + **Win** + **F12** to briefly show all sounds and their respective key.


If you want to modify it, edit **Instant Sounds.ahk** and run **Compile.ahk** to create an executable ([AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) must be installed to compile).
